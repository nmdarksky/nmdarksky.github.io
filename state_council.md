years. 

Initial/current council consists of : John Briggs, Jamey Eriksen,  Galen
Gisler (treasurer), Michael Hensley, Jon Holtzman (chair),
Nick Knorr (secretary), Marisela La Grave, Peter Lipscomb (vice chair),
Gary Starkweather, Sheila Sullivan, and Derek Wallentinsen.

meetings.

**John Briggs**

John W. Briggs has lived and worked at far-ranging observatories
in various technical capacities, including Mount Wilson, Yerkes,
National Solar, Maria Mitchell, Venezuelan National, Chamberlin,
Van Vleck, and South Pole Station.  He came to New Mexico with his
family in 1997 to assist in the final commissioning of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point.  In the 1980s he was an assistant
editor at Sky & Telescope magazine and built Bogsucker Observatory
in Massachusetts.  He is a member of many astronomical organizations
including the Springfield Telescope Makers responsible for the
annual Stellafane Convention in Vermont, and he has served on the
board of the century-old American Association of Variable Star
Observers.  His principal activity now involves the Astronomical
Lyceum, an informal museum, library, laboratory, and lecture hall
devoted to historical astronomy and its preservation, and his role
as secretary of the new Alliance of Historic Observatories.  He is
an adjunct in Physics at NMT in Socorro, and he has participated
in IDA meetings as early as the 1990s.

**Galen Gisler**

Galen Gisler was born under the starry skies of eastern New Mexico
and discovered a passion for astronomy. With a Bachelor’s degree
in physics and astronomy from Yale University and a Ph.D. in
astrophysics from the University of Cambridge, Galen went on to
postdoctoral positions at the Leiden University Observatory and
Kitt Peak National Observatory. He spent two years at the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory, then worked for 25-years at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory and 7 years at the University of Oslo
in Norway, returning to Los Alamos to retire. Galen’s scientific
research has included extragalactic jets, particle beams, plasmas,
astronomical transients, adaptive processing, and hydrocode simulations
of impact processes, tsunamis, and explosive volcanism. In retirement,
he has contributed to astronomy outreach and education, encouraging
people to get outdoors and enjoy the wonders of the night sky.

Jon Holtzman is a professional astronomer and educator. He is currently a full 
Professor of Astronomy at New Mexico State University, where he has worked
since 1995. His research interests have led to significant involvement with 
the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As an educator,
he has taught at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Among other public
outreach efforts, he has run a series of virtual open houses from the 
Tortugas Mountain Observatory outside of Las Cruces.  
As an outdoor enthusiast, he finds respite from looking at the dark nighttime
sky, and wants to ensure that all people have the opportunity to do the same.

Derek Wallentinsen is an independent educator who has been deeply involved in
astronomy outreach and dark skies preservation throughout his life. He is a NASA
JPL Solar System Ambassador, NASA ASP Eclipse Ambassador and AUI Astronomy
in Chile Educator Ambassador, sharing astronomy knowledge with broadly diverse
groups of the public. He has lived in NM since 1958 and has been active in private
and public dark-sky vocations. An early activist for dark skies, Derek drafted a
night-sky friendly municipal lighting ordinance in the 1970s. During his time as a
National Park Service ranger, Derek was instrumental in the certification of
several national parks as International Dark Sky Parks (including Dinosaur
National Monument and El Morro National Monument) and was the recipient of
three STAR awards. He currently is an AstroVIP at several national parks,
monitoring their dark skies and creating various outreach programs and videos.
He formerly worked at the telescope company Celestron and originated the
company’s online knowledgebase.  
Wallentinsen has a Master of Science degree in Astrophysics. In addition to
telescopes, night and day skies, he enjoys desert hiking, geology and birds from
his home base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  
“I want to see New Mexico’s Dark Sky International chapter broaden out to reach
beyond astronomy to biology, human health and cultural impacts.”
