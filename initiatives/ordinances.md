From Gary Starkweather:

1.  I'm interested in being on the Committee for County and Municipal
Outdoor Lighting Ordinances, "Committee," and if agreeable to the
Committee Members and NMDS Board, being Chair of that Committee.

2. Objectives and Purpose 

I suggest that the first order of business for the Outdoor Lighting
Ordinance Committee is to establish a model ordinance, approved by
the Board. This model ordinance may be different than the Dark Sky
model ordinance, and may take influence from the IDA/IES Model
Ordinance, having some modifications. There may also be a differences
between model county and municipal ordinances. All versions of the
model ordinances shall be approved by New Mexico Dark Sky (NMDS).

The NMDS approved ordinances shall be made available on NMDS's web
site for easy access with narratives of purpose and application.
The objective will be to assist any jurisdiction with crafting a
outdoor lighting ordinance and getting it passed with as few
modifications and exceptions as possible.

The Committee shall work to make copies of all existing municipal
and county lighting ordinances available on the NMDS web site. The
Committee shall work to evaluate each known ordinance with regard
to how it does, or does not, address the objectives in the NMDS
approved model ordinances. The Committee shall also work to acquire
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the ordinance, to highlight
issues successfully addressed, or issues that are not well addressed
by the ordinance, including adequate funding for enforcement, and
whether enforcement is sufficient to make the ordinance effective.

The Committee, as a team, shall work to assist interested parties
in development and implementation of new county and municipal
lighting ordinances, with advice and guidance on the political and
other issues that might help facilitate the adoption of new ordinances.

The Committee, as a team, shall also work to assist NMDS in updates
/ modifications to the State's Lighting Ordinance. The New Mexico
Dark Sky Protection Act of 1999 is seriously outdated and has many
flaws. Although updates to this state act are not the primary
objective of NMDS at this time, the Outdoor Lighting Ordinance
Committee would be the most logical resource within NMDS for
assistance and guidance of passing upgrades to the Act. The Board
may have political resources and ongoing relationships with state
representatives for crafting legislation and presenting bills for
consideration..

The Committee shall also have the duty of helping NMDS address any
NMDS objectives, interests of the Board, or assistance to other
NMDS Committees, that would further the initiatives of NMDS.
