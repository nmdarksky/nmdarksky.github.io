Jon Holtzman is a professional astronomer and educator. He is currently a full 
Professor of Astronomy at New Mexico State University, where he has worked
since 1995. His research interests have led to significant involvement with 
the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As an educator,
he has taught at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Among other public
outreach efforts, he has run a series of virtual open houses from the 
Tortugas Mountain Observatory outside of Las Cruces.  
As an outdoor enthusiast, he finds respite from looking at the dark nighttime
sky, and wants to ensure that all people have the opportunity to do the same.
