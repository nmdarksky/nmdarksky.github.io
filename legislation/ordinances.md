### Legislation / Ordinances / Monitoring

Legislation and ordinances can be an important tool to help to preserve dark skies.
New Mexico was a pioneer in passing the statewide Night Sky Protection Act (NSPA) in 1999. However,
light pollution in New Mexico has continued to increase. New Mexico DarkSky is
committed to trying to improve the NSPA, and to assist in efforts to establish
stronger ordinances at more local levels.

#### Goals 

- Update the NM Night Sky Protection Act!
- Establish stronger local ordinances around the state
