## Biological/ecological impact and mitigation

Artificial light at night has adverse effects on many other species, and
this in turn can lead to effects on humans. For example, many pollinators
are adversly affected by light at night, which in turn has the potential
to affect agriculture. 

The bulk of bird migration occurs at night, and the adverse effect of
excess lighting has been documented to disrupt this.
