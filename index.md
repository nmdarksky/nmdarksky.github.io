## Welcome to New Mexico DarkSky

Vision:
*New Mexico DarkSky seeks to restore and preserve New Mexicoâ€™s
heritage of brilliant, star- filled skies and dark nighttime
environments. We endeavor to eliminate light pollution throughout
the State and protect all communities from its harmful effects,
through advocacy, outreach, education, and conservation.*

Founded in June 2023, we are a state chapter of [DarkSky International](https://darksky.org).
All members of DarkSky International in the state of New Mexico are chapter members. The
activities of the chapter are managed by the State Council of the organization.
