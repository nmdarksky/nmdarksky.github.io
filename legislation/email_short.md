Dear Senator (or Representative)  XX,

I'm contacting you as a constituent to express my strong support for bill in the the 2025 legislative session that will update the existing Night Sky Protection Act and to ask you to support it.

New Mexico has a valuable resource in its dark skies: they attract visitors and new residents, are part of our cultural heritage, and are important for human health and wildlife. The state recognized this in 1999 and passed the Night Sky Protection Act. However, much has changed in the last 25 years, and light pollution has continued to increase.  Fortunately, new technology and increased awareness has led us to recognize that we can implement responsible lighting that meets or exceeds needs including safety and security while at the same time protecting our skies and the values that they offer.

The New Mexico Chapter of DarkSky International is proposing some small, but impactful, modifications to the Night Sky Protection Act, requiring new lighting to be shielded to a modern standard and to remove some of the exemptions in the original act that are no longer necessary.  These are common-sense changes that will help to keep light pollution from continuing to increase.

Dear Senator (or Representative)  XX,

Since the 1999 Dark Sky Protection Act (NSPA) was passed, modern LED lighting technology combined with poor application practices has resulted in the rapid growth of light pollution and loss of our naturally dark skies. The NSPA has proven to be inadequate to protect our night skies so SB34 has was drafted to more effectively protect our naturally dark skies. 

Modern lighting fixtures and installation practices are now available that meet the highest safely standards while also protecting our night skies which retires any need for industry wide exemptions. The bill includes many common sense exemptions like sports centers and movie film sets. 

These new lighting standards cost no more to install than old lighting practices and save on maintenance and energy costs too. 

SB34 establishes modern lighting standards to meet safety and lighting needs equally well for all public and industry lighting applications. The new standards do not cause any disadvantage or higher costs for private or public uses. Actually,  new lighting projects designed to new standards can cost less than existing standards and cost far less to maintain and operate.

This Bill protects New Mexicoâ€™s dark natural resources. As a voter and taxpayer of New Mexico, I need you to support SB34.
