### International Dark Sky Association Application

The Cosmic Campground is a 1.42 hectare (3.5 acre) site in the Gila
National Forest of western New Mexico, U.S. Situated between the
Gila Wilderness and the Blue Range Primitive Area, it is located
on land managed by the United States Forest Service. The Campground
is located in an exceptionally dark part of the lower 48 U.S. states,
with the nearest significant source of artificial light more than
65 kilometers away across the state line in Arizona. The Campground
features a very basic infrastructure to support campers and offers
a 360-degree, unobstructed, view of the night sky.  The

to become an International Dark Sky
Sanctuary is a 46 page description and evaluation of the site.

The announcement that the Cosmic Campground has been designated as an International Dark Sky
Sanctuary was announced at the meeting of the Catron County Commission January 14, 2016.

"The Cosmic Campground in Catron County brings visitors from around the United States and the
world to enjoy New Mexico’s unmatched wild places,” said Senator Heinrich. "Outdoor recreation is a
huge draw for the state and contributes to our economy as a whole. I was glad to support the Cosmic
Campground’s effort in becoming an International Dark Sky Sanctuary, and I am pleased with their
success. This designation will elevate the status of western New Mexico as a true destination for star
gazers and dark sky enthusiasts all while boosting the economies of local communities."

### A History of the Cosmic Campground, North of  Alma, NM.

This account of the history of the Cosmic Campground is related by
C. William McCabe (Bill), a local resident, October 22, 2013.
Additions have been added since then.

Work on this project began in 2003. Bill, and his wife, Val, had
retired and purchased the Alma Store in southwestern New Mexico.
Business was slow in the off-seasons and Bill and Val were looking
for ways to enhance the income of businesses in the area. While
visiting with a friend, Bob Robinson, the subject of “Dark Skies”
came up. Bob suggested looking up the term on the Internet. In so
doing, Bill became aware of the great interest in Dark Skies by the
Amateur Astronomy Community.

Realizing that this area had great potential as a dark skies site,
Bill began searching throughout the area around Glenwood and Alma
for a suitable site that would support the needs of astronomers.
Prowling the area with a neighbor, Richard Weaver, several potential
sites were identified. Major criteria were accessibility and shielding
from highway lights. A campground was determined to be the most
useful mechanism to draw astronomers. (Take only pictures, leave
only footprints)

Eventually, a site was selected eight miles north of Alma, just one
mile off of US 180. The site was down a two-track cow path in the
Gila National Forest.

In order to verify the suitability of this location, Bill took to
the Internet again, seeking a qualified reviewer. Contacting the
Texas Astronomical Society of Dallas, Bill was referred to John
Wagoner, Observing Chairman for the Texas Star Party. After John
reviewed the site and considered how it related to amateur astronomy,
he agreed to travel to Alma.

John’s first night in the area turned cloudy. John said “Not to
worry, we will go to the site and check for Light Domes”. Arriving
at the site we were surprised to see the night sky turn clear. That
night was amazingly gratifying. Attached is John’s review for
consideration. This was in January of 2004.

With John’s evaluation in hand Bill solicited the support of the
local US Forest Service office. Their personnel visited the site
and agreed that such a project would be an asset to this area and
that they would support developing a Dark Skies campground here.

About this time, Bill was invited to a Star Party on a local mesa
conducted by Dr. Albert Grauer, Professor of Astronomy at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock  . Dr. Grauer is an advocate
of amateur astronomy as well as a professional astronomer. He and
his wife Ann became enthusiastically involved in establishing the
campground.

Further evaluations were conducted by the Silver city Astronomical
Society. An in-depth evaluation of the nighttime sky was conducted
by Gary Emerson, President of the Silver City Astronomical Society.
This evaluation was extremely favorable. See the web page on this
site.

At this time, funding became the name of the game. The Gila District
of the US Forest Service did not have discretionary funding to cover
this project. Bill contacted State and Federal offices requesting
consideration; there were significant letters of encouragement but
funding was not part of the encouragement.

Small star parties, conducted by astronomy clubs such as a club
from NM State University, mentored by Dr. Dan Klinglesmith and
associate Jon Spargo, began frequenting the area. At the encouragement
of teacher Terry Tackman, a star party was held for students of the
Glenwood primary school by Dr. Al Grauer.

After three changes in personnel at the Glenwood District Ranger’s
office, Ranger Pat Morrison took the helm.

Pat Morrison had contemplated a dark skies campground for years.
She made it happen by  becoming aware of funding potential through
Title II funds supporting Counties in SW New Mexico. The funds would
be evaluated and released through a Resource Advisory Committee
including local resident, Debra Krikorian. Debra was eager to review
the request in committee. In December of 2010 a presentation was
made to the committee that included an overall finished campground,
with an auxiliary campground nearer the highway. Participants were
awarded $50,000, the minimum required to build an all-weather access
road and put the footprint of the primary campground on the map.

An Environmental Assessment was completed that decided to construct
two campgrounds, with the primary campground, a group campground
for astronomers and other groups as Phase One. Phase two will be
the general purpose campground closer to the highway.

In November, 2012, a Forest Service crew began construction. The
earthwork and surfacing, overlaying the two track cow path, were
finished the following spring. This was an exceptional job for the
money. See photos elsewhere on this web site..

The first official star party was held in October of 2013.

The sponsor was Lois Fuller for the WILLL, Western Institute for
Life Long Learning, out of Silver City New Mexico. The Silver City
Astronomical Society participated with around six telescopes. A
good time was had by all.

In September, 2013, Pat Morrison convened a meeting to design
concrete pads for the facility. Attending from the Forest Service
were Pat, Forest Service engineer Tracy Weber, and Forest Service
Maintenance supervisor Bob Shanks. Al and Annie Grauer, Bob and
Elayne Bryant, Rich Wright and Bill McCabe represented the astronomy
personnel. The discussion and design went very well with superb
input from the astronomers. The first pads will be installed as
funds and labor are available.

As of fall of 2013, the project is seeking additional funds to
complete the job. Completing Phase one is estimated to be ~$74,000.
Phase two construction is estimated at ~$85,000.

In 2014 the New Mexico Resource Advisory Committee awarded $40,000
for a CTX toilet.

Patricia A. Grauer, "Annie" is responsible for the name Cosmic
Campground. She was determined to obtain dark sky certification by
the International Dark Sky Association.

In 2014 and 2015 Patricia A. Grauer  and Dr. Al Grauer collected
data, prepared, and submitted an application to the International
Dark Sky Association requesting that the Cosmic Campground be
designated as an International Dark Sky Sanctuary. Please see the
application for the details.

On January 14, 2016 The International Dark Sky Association Designated
the Cosmic Campground as the first International Dark Sky Sanctuary
in North America.
