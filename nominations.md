**Suzanne Eisenberg**


I recently graduated with a bachelor's of physics with an astronomy
concentration from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
I have a passion for science communication and would like to use
my background to help with astronomy public outreach in New Mexico,
so that it can be enjoyed by all! I believe that I can do this
through being elected to the state council of NM DarkSky
and look forward to working with you all!


**Gina Pearson**

Gina recently retired as a federal public servant, after 35+ years,
primarily working for the National Park Service throughout the west.
She has years of experience protecting naturally dark night skies
with a particular interest in preserving indigenous and other
cultural perspectives. Some of her dark sky work includes developing
dark sky park application packets for Bryce Canyon National Park
and the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument, collaborating with
National Park Units across the nation on mitigating light pollution
impacts, collaborating with the American Indigenous Tourism Association
on night sky education, translating into Spanish the NPS Jr. Ranger
Night Explorer booklet, updating the public facing NPS Night Skies
website, coordinating the events for the August 21, 2017 total solar
eclipse at the BLM Challis Field Office, ID, and serving as the NPS
point of contact for the Colorado Plateau Dark Sky Cooperative.

**Rachael Bechtel**

Currently a graduate student at UNM, Rachael is an astrophotographer
who wants to get more involved in the NM chapter of DarkSky.
