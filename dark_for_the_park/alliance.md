## Dark for the Park Alliance

The Dark for the Park Alliance is a collaboration between the National Park Service (particularly Carlsbad Caverns National Park and Chaco Canyon National Historical Park), 
the BLM, the NM State Lands Office, the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA) and DarkSky International. It was founded to try to improve the impact that the oil
and gas industry has on night skies at New Mexico National Parks. 

It has resulted in the establishment of a certification program (by DarkSky International) 
for oil and gas facilities that implement responsible lighting. A pilot project by Franklin Mountain Energy
at several of their sites in SE New Mexico resulted in the first certification of this program in late 2024.

The group has also developed a [Lighting Guide for the Energy Industry](Dark_Park_-_Lighting_Guidance.pdf)
