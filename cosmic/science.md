The paper uses data from the Cosmic Campground International Dark Sky
Sanctuary (CCIDSS) in the USA and the Aotea/Great Barrier Island International
Dark Sky Sanctuary (AGBIIDSS) in New Zealand to begin to understand the
connection between solar activity the the natural night brightness. It documents,
even during solar minimum, the natural night sky changes in brightness by more
than 0.9 mag arcsec²

Abstract: In 2018, Solar Cycle 24 entered a deep solar minimum. During this period, we
collected night sky brightness data at Cosmic Campground International Dark
Sky Sanctuary (CCIDSS) in the USA (2018 September 4–2019 January4) and
at Aotea/Great Barrier Island International Dark Sky Sanctuary (AGBIIDSS)
iNew Zealand (2018 March 26–August 31. These sites have artificial-light-
pollution- free natural night skies. The equipment employed are identical
Unihedron SQM-LU-DL meters, used as single-channel differential photometers,
to scan the sky as Earth rotates on its axis. We have developed new analysis
techniques which select those data points which are uninfluenced by Sun,
Moon, or clouds to follow brightness changes at selected points on the celestial
sphere and to measure the brightness of the airglow above its quiescent level.
The 2018 natural night sky was measured to change in brightness by
approximately 0.9 mag arcsec² at both locations. Preliminary results indicate the
modulations of the light curves (brightness versus R.A.) we observed are related
in complex ways to elements of space weather conditions in the near-Earth
environment. In particular, episodes of increased night sky brightness are
observed to be contemporaneous with geomagnetic activity, increases in mean
solar wind speed, and some solar proton/electron fluence events. Charged
particles in the solar wind take days to reach near-Earth environment after a
coronal hole is observed to be facing in our direction. Use of this information
could make it possible to predict increases in Earth’s natural night sky
brightness several days in advance. What we have learned during this solar
minimum leads us to search for other solar driven changes in night sky
brightness as the Sun begins to move into solar maximum conditions

This paper shows that data from a natural night sky location (Cosmic
Campground IDSS) is unexpectedly required to correctly interpret the results of
a light pollution mitigating experiment. See Figure 9 and the discussion in this
publication.

Abstract: Anthropogenic skyglow dominates views of the natural night sky in most urban
settings, and the associated emission of artificial light at night (ALAN) into the
environment of cities involves a number of known and suspected negative
externalities. One approach to lowering consumption of ALAN in cities is
dimming or extinguishing publicly owned outdoor lighting during overnight hours;
however, there are few reports in the literature about the efficacy of these
programs. Here we report the results of one of the largest municipal lighting
dimming experiments to date, involving ~ 20,000 roadway luminaires owned and
operated by the City of Tucson, Arizona, U.S. We analyzed both single channel
and spatially resolved ground-based measurements of broadband night sky
radiance obtained during the tests, determining that the zenith sky brightness
during the tests decreased by (−5.4 ± 0.9)% near the city center
and (−3.6 ± 0.9)% at an adjacent suburban location on nights when the output of
the street lighting system was dimmed from 90% of its full power draw to 30%
after local midnight. Modeling these changes with a radiative transfer code
yields results suggesting that street lights account for about (14 ± 1)% of light
emissions resulting in skyglow seen over the city. A separate derivation from first
principles implies that street lighting contributes only 2 − 3% of light seen at the
zenith over Tucson. We discuss this inconsistency and suggest routes for future
work.

This paper present new scientific results and documents the quality of the
natural night sky at the Cosmic Campground IDSS. See Figure 3 and the
discussion below it for the characterization of a really dark night at three sites.
In particular at the Cosmic Campground IDSS the night of the night of 2019
February 7–8 is the darkest night ever measured (22.128 mag/arcsec²,
stdev = 0.016).


Abstract: This paper presents time-series observations and analysis of broadband night
sky airglow intensity 4 September 2018 through 30 April 2020. Data were
obtained at 5 sites spanning more than 8500 km during the historically deep
minimum of Solar Cycle 24 into the beginning of Solar Cycle 25. New time-
series observations indicate previously unrecognized significant sources of
broadband night sky brightness variations, not involving corresponding changes
in the Sun’s 10.7 cm solar flux, occur during deep solar minimum. New data
show; (1) Even during a deep solar minimum the natural night sky is rarely, if
ever, constant in brightness. Changes with time-scales of minutes, hours, days,
and months are observed. (2) Semi-annual night sky brightness variations are
coincident with changes in the orientation of Earth’s magnetic field relative to the
interplanetary magnetic field. (3) Solar wind plasma streams from solar coronal
holes arriving at Earth’s bow shock nose are coincident with major night sky
brightness increase events. (4) Sites more than 8500 km along the Earth’s
surface experience nights in common with either very bright or very faint night
sky airglow emissions. The reason for this observational fact remains an open
question. (5) It is plausible, terrestrial night airglow and geomagnetic indices
have similar responses to the solar energy input into Earth’s magnetosphere.
Our empirical results contribute to a quantitative basis for understanding and
predicting broadband night sky brightness variations. They are applicable in
astronomical, planetary science, space weather, light pollution, biological, and
recreational studies.
