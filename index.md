## Welcome to New Mexico DarkSky

Founded in June 2023, we are a state chapter of [DarkSky International](https://darksky.org).
All members of DarkSky International in the state of New Mexico are chapter members. The
activities of the chapter are managed by the State Council of the organization.

Vision:
*New Mexico DarkSky seeks to restore and preserve New Mexico’s
ancestral heritage of majestic, star- filled skies and dark nighttime
environments. We endeavor to eliminate light pollution throughout
the State and protect all communities from its harmful effects,
through advocacy, outreach, education, and conservation.*

Mission: <i>The Organization will strive to:
- <i>become the leading force for protecting New Mexico’s existing Dark Sky places and for eliminating light pollution throughout the State.</i>
- <i>develop professional credibility with government, industry, and the public as the authoritative voice for outstanding, protective, and safe outdoor lighting policies.</i>
- <i>bring the experience, expertise, and resources of DarkSky International to enhance and enrich our State-wide work.</i>
