 Jon Holtzman is a professional astronomer and educator. He is currently a full 
 Professor of Astronomy at New Mexico State University, where he has worked
 since 1995. His research interests have led to significant involvement with 
 the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As an educator,
 he has taught at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Among other public
 outreach efforts, he has run a series of virtual open houses from the 
 Tortugas Mountain Observatory outside of Las Cruces.

 As an outdoor enthusiast, he finds respite from looking at the dark nighttime
 sky, and wants to ensure that all people have the opportunity to do the same.
