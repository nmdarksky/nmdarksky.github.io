### If you are planning to visit

Sign the visitor log near the observing area. This is very important
since the US Forest Service views this as a key indicator of
campground usage.  The more people that sign in the more likely it
is that the US Forest Service will add a Pavilion and other necessary
improvements.

You are guests of the Gila National Forest. You are responsible for
your children and pets.

Not everyone who visits the site is aware of its special designation
as a DarkSky Sanctuary. We need to work together and communicate
politely to ensure that visitors treat the nighttime environment
and dark sky conditions with respect.

Bring: 
- Binoculars, or a Telescope if you have one
- An open mind to visually explore the natural night sky horizon to zenith.
- Food and Water [local markets & restaurants are good but limited hours]
If you Need it/Bring it
- Full tank of Gasoline [local gas stations close early/fill up on way]
- Folding chairs, folding table if you want one, etc
- Camping Equipment to stay the night
- A red flashlight. If you don't have one, you can make a red written
plastic filter for your flashlight and attach it with a rubber band.
You should be able to view star maps etc in a dark area with this
arrangement. Your night vision will be at its best if you do not
look at a white light for at least 30 min.  You need to do the same
for your cell phone or keep it off to enable your eyes to see faint
objects. If you look at white light from your cell phone you will
not be able to enjoy the wonders of the natural night sky for 20-30
minutes.

Please Respect Your Fellow Stargazers:
- NO Headlights or white lights after dark.
- Night vision is required to enjoy the Natural Night Sky.

### International Dark Sky Association Application

The Cosmic Campground is a 1.42 hectare (3.5 acre) site in the Gila
National Forest of western New Mexico, U.S. Situated between the
Gila Wilderness and the Blue Range Primitive Area, it is located
on land managed by the United States Forest Service. The Campground
is located in an exceptionally dark part of the lower 48 U.S. states,
with the nearest significant source of artificial light more than
65 kilometers away across the state line in Arizona. The Campground
features a very basic infrastructure to support campers and offers
a 360-degree, unobstructed, view of the night sky.  The Application
for the Cosmic Campground to become an International Dark Sky
Sanctuary is a 46 page description and evaluation of the site.

The announcement that the Cosmic Campground has been designated as an International Dark Sky
Sanctuary was announced at the meeting of the Catron County Commission January 14, 2016.

"The Cosmic Campground in Catron County brings visitors from around the United States and the
world to enjoy New Mexico’s unmatched wild places,” said Senator Heinrich. "Outdoor recreation is a
huge draw for the state and contributes to our economy as a whole. I was glad to support the Cosmic
Campground’s effort in becoming an International Dark Sky Sanctuary, and I am pleased with their
success. This designation will elevate the status of western New Mexico as a true destination for star
gazers and dark sky enthusiasts all while boosting the economies of local communities."
