Proclamation Declaring April 21-28, 2025, as "International Dark Sky Week" (Accepted by Heidi Morris, Pajarito Astronomers President)

 

WHEREAS, the aesthetic beauty and wonder of the natural night sky in Los Alamos County is shared heritage of all humankind, and the experience of standing beneath a starry night sky inspires feelings of wonder and awe, and encourages a growing interest in science and nature, especially among young people and out-of-area visitors; and

 

WHEREAS, light pollution has scientifically-established economic and environmental consequences, which result in significant impacts to the ecology and human health of all communities and 80-percent of the world's population lives under a dome of light pollution and may never experience the visual wonder or benefits of living under a dark sky; and

 

WHEREAS, Los Alamos County is home to major scientific facilities, some of which are dedicated to observing the night sky on a regular basis, and the canyons and mountains of the Pajarito Plateau are home to dozens of nocturnal wildlife species which rely on undisturbed night environments to hunt, mate and thrive; and

 

WHEREAS, the Valles Caldera National Preserve has been recognized as an International Dark Sky Park and the Bandelier National Monument is pursuing such recognition, and

 

WHEREAS, the International Dark Sky Week aims to raise awareness of light pollution, and provide free education, resources, and solutions to the public to encourage the protection of and enjoyment of dark skies and responsible outdoor lighting, and

 

WHEREAS, local organization, Pajarito Astronomers Club, has partnered with Los Alamos County to host monthly "Dark Nights" observation sessions starting March 2025, at White Rock Overlook Complex, where field lights will be turned off to provide the community the opportunity to view the wonders of the night sky through telescopes.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, on behalf of the Council of the Incorporated County of Los Alamos, I do hereby declare April 21-28, 2025, as

 

"INTERNATIONAL DARK-SKY WEEK"

 

in Los Alamos County and ask each resident to join me, not only in observing this important week, but also in raising awareness and support for protecting our previous dark sky resources.
