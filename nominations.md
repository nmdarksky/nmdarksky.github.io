Terms expiring 2025:  John Briggs, Jon Holtzman (chair), Marisela La Grave, Jim Price

**John Briggs**

John W. Briggs has lived and worked at far-ranging observatories
in various technical capacities, including Mount Wilson, Yerkes,
National Solar, Maria Mitchell, Venezuelan National, Chamberlin,
Van Vleck, and South Pole Station.  He came to New Mexico with his
family in 1997 to assist in the final commissioning of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point.  In the 1980s he was an assistant
editor at Sky & Telescope magazine and built Bogsucker Observatory
in Massachusetts.  He is a member of many astronomical organizations
including the Springfield Telescope Makers responsible for the
annual Stellafane Convention in Vermont, and he has served on the
board of the century-old American Association of Variable Star
Observers.  His principal activity now involves the Astronomical
Lyceum, an informal museum, library, laboratory, and lecture hall
devoted to historical astronomy and its preservation, and his role
as secretary of the new Alliance of Historic Observatories.  He is
an adjunct in Physics at NMT in Socorro, and he has participated
in IDA meetings as early as the 1990s.

John has been a member of the State Council and is standing for re-election
to a second term.

**Jon Holtzman**

Jon Holtzman is a professional astronomer and educator. He is currently an Emeritus
Professor of Astronomy at New Mexico State University, where he has worked
since 1995. His research interests have led to significant involvement with 
the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As an educator,
he has taught at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Among other public
outreach efforts, he has run a series of virtual open houses from the 
Tortugas Mountain Observatory outside of Las Cruces.  
As an outdoor enthusiast, he finds respite from looking at the dark nighttime
sky, and wants to ensure that all people have the opportunity to do the same.

Jon has been the Chair of the State Council for the last year, and is standing for re-election
to a second term on the Council.

**Marisela La Grave**

Marisela La Grave,  is the founder of [Dark Sky Land, Inc](http://www.darkskyland.us), an
interdisciplinary night-ecology-wildlife conservation organization,
with the mission to preserve a 600-mile astro-wildlife corridor in
western New Mexico.  She is a New York and New Mexico based Intermedia artist, director,
producer, filmmaker, photographer and creator of a collaborative
multilayered spectrum of interdisciplinary projects.
Her works include the creation and production of experimental films,
site-specific installations, essay style documentaries, and time
based works for camera, that have been screened, exhibited, presented,
installed, and published internationally and housed in private
collections and museums around the world. She is the  co-founder
and the Artistic Director at Magnetic Laboratorium™ (2001-2025) a
New York - Paris - New Mexico  based transdisciplinary studio.

Marisela has been a member of the State Council and is standing for re-election
to a second term.

**Sarah McIntyre**

I'm a scientist and photographer/astrophotographer in Albuquerque.
I am a lifelong New Mexican, and have spent my entire life appreciating
New Mexico's dark skies. As my longstanding interest in astronomy
has expanded into astrophotography (and that has expanded from
nightscapes to deep space imagery) in recent years, the importance
of taking action to protect our dark skies has become increasingly
important to me. I'm excited to be a member of NM DarkSky and look
forward to being involved with efforts to educate the public and
raise awareness of dark skies as a vital natural resource.

**Colin Nicholls**

Colin Nicholls is a PhD Physicist who spent the first 20 years of
his career developing advanced instrumentation for industrial process
control in Hi Tech research institutions in the US and the UK.  For
the last 23 years he has worked in education in Taos county, first
at Taos High School and now at UNM Taos, where he is currently
Science Department Chair.  A long time visual astronomer, Nicholls
is on the board of the El Valle Astronomers and is working with
that club,  UNM Taos and the Taos County planners to update the
county’s Dark Sky ordinances.


**Jim Price**

Jim Price is practically a native New Mexican. He has lived in
Albuquerque since most of what is now developed was dirt. Jim worked
for a lighting company and then started his own. He has sold lighting
ranging from miniature lighting for microscopes to parking lot
lighting for every type of business. Jim realized the need for
shielded lighting when shopping malls and other businesses around
Albuquerque with parking lots enlisted him to help them be better
neighbors. He realized then that lighting can be made more comfortable
and effective through proper aiming and shielding. He has adopted
a less is more philosophy with lighting. For example, less glare
means more visual acuity. Less stark contrast means more awareness
of surroundings. He truly believes that taking the “less” approach
leads to “more” satisfying results.

Jim has been a member of the State Council and is standing for re-election
to a second term.

**Didier Saumon**

Didier Saumon has been an amateur astronomer for nearly 50 years
and has a fondness for visual observations of the deep sky and
exotic objects. He enjoys sharing his passion for the night sky
with the public at star parties in the surrounding area. Until his
recent retirement, he was an astrophysicist  studying white dwarfs,
brown dwarfs, exoplanets, and the properties of matter under the
extreme conditions found in these objects. He's had an interest in
outdoor lighting and light pollution for three decades and contributed
to the development and adoption of a modern lighting ordinance in
the county of Los Alamos. He's witnessed the steady erosion of the
night sky over the past 20 years and wants to see it stopped. On
good days, he dreams of seeing it reversed to a reasonable level
for the benefit of all. May the stars be with you.
