**Monthly State Council meetings**

Affairs of the NM chapter are managed by a [State Council](../state_council). The State
Council meets monthly on the first non-holiday Monday of the month. Meetings are currently
(2025) held at 4:00pm via Zoom. All members of the NM chapter are welcome to attend
State Council meetings. Agenda and connection information are distributed only
shortly before the meeting, but the monthly first Monday schedule is established
in advance.

**Committee meetings**

Committees of the State Council meet on intervening Mondays: legislation/ordinances
on second Monday, outreach/education on third Monday, and dark sky places on fourth
Monday.
