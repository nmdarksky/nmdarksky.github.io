This was motivated by interest in establishing a regional effort on preserving and improving dark skies in the southwest US. DarkSky International received funding to support such an effort from the Carroll Petrie Foundation. In addition to supporting the formation of a state chapter, DarkSky also proposed to hold a stakeholder workshop on dark skies.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">A New Mexico chapter was formed in March 2023. After spending a few months of meetings to discuss organizational structure and learn about each other and our interests, the initial ad hoc State Council agreed to partner with DarkSky International to hold a workshop. After some discussion, it was decided that the main goal of the workshop was to learn about the interests and efforts of groups around the state towards an effort to establish a broad consortium to effect change. This goal was motivated in part by past experience that when dark skies were perceived as a special interest (e.g., from those interested in astronomy), it was more challenging to make progress.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Different members of the group made contacts with various organizations and individuals around the state to invite people to a meeting. While some effort was made to try to contact a diversity of groups, contacts were largely made informally, and it is likely that there are interested parties that were not contacted. Most of the contacted groups responded and many committed to sending a representative to a meeting, but there were also some groups from which we did not get responses.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The stakeholder meeting was convened on December 1, 2023 in the Macy Center at New Mexico Tech, organized jointly by the New Mexico Chapter and DarkSky International. The agenda for the meeting included short presentations from representatives of groups describing their interest, a short breakout session to discuss broad goals and challenges, a set of four presentations focussed on the NM Night Sky Protection Act, local ordinances, basic principles of good lighting, and light standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society. The agenda is presented in Appendix A.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reports from interested groups</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Presentations were made by 14 different groups:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Cody Johnson spoke as representative from New Mexico True. In an effort to identify public interest in different aspects of New Mexico, they found that images that included dark skies registered high in public interest, motivating a dark sky component of NM True. Dark Sky content is included on their social media pages, and they would be interested in listing additional events. They continue to see the potential of dark skies to attract out-of-state visitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Grady Owens from New Mexico Skies spoke about their facility in Mayhill, which is one of several private domain astronomical facilities in the state that host telescopes for people around the world (both professional and amateur astronomers) that generally operate them remotely. Dark Sky New Mexico in Animas and Deep Sky West in Rowe are two other similar facilities. There are also a number of residential communities such as Astronomers Paradise in Rodeo that feature large numbers of residents interested in dark skies from the amateur astronomy perspective.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Eamon Brennan from the BLM spoke towards a presentation put together by McKinney Briske (who was unable to attend). BLM is responsible for more land in New Mexico than any other federal agency, so there is a lot of potential for dark sky presentation. Two established Dark Sky locations are on BLM land, and BLM is interested in getting more declared. BLM recognizes that dark skies are important for wildlife habitat. BLM recently developed an extensive document regarding best practices for light.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Peter Lipscomb spoke as a representative of NM State Parks and provided a summary of New Mexico State Park’s actions during the Reach for the Stars program (2005-2010). Highlighted observatories at City of Rocks State Park and Clayton Lake State Park and Dinosaur Trackways. Clayton Lake was the first designated International Dark Sky Park in New Mexico (June 27 th , 2010). Hybrid observatory project at Leaburg Dam State Park. A collaboration with Las Cruces Astronomical Society. Shared overview of New Mexico State Parks public engagement and interest in a dark night sky and the fact that night sky interpretation events are the most popular educational programs offered at parks locations. New Mexico State Parks is interested to restore the outdoor classroom program to continue and build on the legacy of Reach for the Stars.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">John Winscott and Brian McLoughlin spoke from the State Lands Office, which manages lands throughout the state, with a goal of generating revenue for state use, e.g., in education. These include lands on which oil and gas leases are held, which generate significant revenue. It has been recognized that land leased for oil and gas development often has significant light pollution, with thousands of sites having 24-hour lighting. However, there has been some recent discussion about reducing light pollution, in particular with representatives from Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The State Lands Commissioner is committed to being a better steward of state land.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Zandra Fleming, a geologist working for Chevron, spoke about the recent discussions between the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association and Carlsbad Caverns to reduce light</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">pollution issues. They have discussed a “Dark for the Park Alliance”, and are collaborating with McDonald Observatory in west Texas, where there is a program that recognizes efforts to reduce light pollution by the oil and gas industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Brian Jensen spoke about dark skies interests of the Santa Fe Conservation Trust, which was founded in 1993 to protect culturally and environmentally significant landscapes. Their programming includes night sky events. They have recently established a program to put monitoring equipment around Sante Fe to track changes in night sky brightness.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Trish Cutler, a biologist at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), talked about the impact of artificial light at night on birds and other animals. Artificial light impacts navigation/migration (much bird migration takes place at night), and there is also mortality associated with attraction to structures with bright lighting. WSMR views dark skies as a programmatic asset and has a lighting code that allows for artificial light, but limited in time, space, intensity and spectrum. She described some technical developments in lighting and noted that even fixtures advertised as DarkSky approved can have significant light pollution if not installed properly. WSMR has incorporated some custom shields.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Anna Walker from New Mexico Biopark Society and Kaitlin Haase from the Xerces Society spoke about biological/ecological impacts largely on invertebrates, insects, etc, where artificial light at night (ALAN) has significant adverse effects, leading to declines of insect population and diversity across the globe. They noted that insects are important for pollination as well as being at the base of the food web; moths, for example, are important nighttime pollinators. Anna noted the significant impact on fireflies, which includes 13 species in New Mexico (!), and suggested that, as a charismatic species, these could be a poster child for a dark sky campaign.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Catherine deMaria, the Director of Warehouse 110 in Magdalena, and Marisela La Grave (Dark Sky Land) spoke about the Dark Sky Land movement, a project to preserve a 100 mile corridor from Magdalena west to the Arizona border. They have established a Dark Sky Land exhibition series, which combines science and art; 500 people viewed their last installation.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">John Briggs from the Astronomical Lyceum spoke about efforts in the Magdalena area related to dark skies. They have been organizing an annual Enchanted Skies Star Party. John noted that dark skies are an economic force, with many people moving to dark places in New Mexico to enjoy the night skies and astronomy; he noted that many real estate listings include a mention of dark skies. John also noted a recent speaker, Mario Motta, who highlighted the negative human health aspects of light pollution.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Antoine Ribaut from the Magdalena Astronomical Society also spoke of the value of dark skies in the Magdalena region. He is a dark sky activist and suggested that the concept of light trespass was important to convey to people and could be effective.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Eileen Ryan from New Mexico Tech and the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO) discussed the value of dark skies to professional astronomy. MRO has a 2.4m telescope that has been operational since 2007 with fast slewing capability. It is a flagship facility for NASA and the Air Force for space domain studies and planetary defense (from asteroids). MRO also hosts an optical interferometer. Both the University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University (NMSU) also have active astronomy programs; NMSU operates the Apache Point Observatory which is funded by a consortium of universities around the country. These programs depend on dark skies. The facilities also serve to attract graduate students  to  these  institutions.  Preservation  of  dark  skies  protects research-dollar investments in observatories and universities. Eileen also talked about efforts to preserve dark skies in the Socorro area by positive conversations with city council members to limit lighting (e.g., LED billboards).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Robert Johnson from the Starfire Optical Range discussed their efforts on laser-beacon adaptive optics, which they use to observe artificial satellites. They operate two facilities, one outside of Albuquerque and another in Maui. He noted that from their range south of Albuquerque, it is mostly useless looking north; looking south much better but growth in Los Lunas may threaten that capability.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Presentations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Night Sky Protection Act</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Peter Lipscomb gave an overview of the New Mexico Night Sky Protection Act (NSPA) . He provided some background on how it got started, noting that it was motivated in part by considering the night sky as a cultural and natural resource. Initial efforts to define it were supported by the New Mexico Heritage Preservation Alliance and the NSPA was passed in 1999. Peter described some of the history:</p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">1999: Representative Pauline Gubbels (Republican, Bernallio county) carried legislation HB 39 to pass the New Mexico Night Sky Protection Act. Passed and signed into law by Governor Gary Johnson. While the NSPA set a statewide minimum standard, no enforcement clause was in the original act.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">2001: Pauline Gubbels returned with HB 613 to narrow scope of act to state buildings and to clarify that the state Construction Industries Division was the regulatory body. The rurther added an enforcement clause, but with permissive language: “a governing body of a political subdivision of the state may enforce the provisions of the Night Sky Protection Act.”</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">2007: John Arthur Smith carried SB 391 with language stating “each political subdivision of the state shall fully enforce the provisions of the Night Sky Protection Act”. It passed both Senate committees but was heard by only 1 of 2 house committee before the session expired.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">2009: HB 362 Donna Irwin gave us a second chance at changing permissive language. Peter was involve and learned some good ways to compress the timeline through both legislative chambers, allowing successful passage.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">2019: HB 620 was co-sponsored by Liz Stefanics and Nathan Small, and included revisions more relevant to developments in lighting technology. The bill was tabled by Joseph Cervantes, chair of the Senate Conservation Committee. Perceived lack of statewide coalition support caused the effort to fail.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Peter noted that the NSPA has been less effective than it should be and that there are several issues, including technical language that is no longer appropriate (specifies wattage rather than lumens or lux, BUG standards, color temperature, etc.) and that there are built-in exceptions that need to be tightened up and constrained. He noted that the NSPA defines a statewide minimum standard, and that local ordinances can be more stringent. He proposed that a broad coalition work to get a revision done in 2025, and that this will require broad support, meetings  with our legislators, getting into interim committee meetings, and addressing new questions and concerns.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Local ordinances in New Mexico</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Galen Gisler surveyed the lighting ordinances that presently exist in 33 jurisdictions around the state. Most of them are very rudimentary, mentioning shielding and adherence to New Mexico’s Night Sky Protection Act, but lacking quantitative guidance on illuminance limits, light trespass, and colors. A few of these municipal ordinances, written in the 1990s, are badly in need of updating, but even some more recent ordinances are inadequate considering modern lighting technology. The Los Alamos County ordinance, initially drafted in 2021, modified during 2022, and passed by the County Council that December, is the most up-to-date and thorough, and is serving as a model for new ordinances in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Lighting is a technical issue, much more so than other issues that are covered in municipal ordinances such as building heights and setbacks. Education is therefore required to bring policy makers and public safety officers up to speed on issues of illuminance, color temperature, and light trespass, all of which are relevant for preserving darkness to benefit wildlife, human health, and the cultural treasury of the night sky. Because enforcement of lighting ordinances is difficult (municipal staff rarely work at night), education and peer pressure are more effective than penalties.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principles of Good Lighting</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Brian Liebel discussed the development by DarkSky International and the Illuminating Engineering Society of the Five Principles of Responsible Outdoor Lighting, now two years old, based on the idea of being conscious about how light affects people, flora, fauna, and night sky and being responsible with light:</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">useful: Use light only if it is needed</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">targeted: Direct light so it falls only where it is needed</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">low level: Light should be no brighter than necessary</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">controlled: Light only when it is needed</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">warm: use Warmer light (lower color temperature) when possible</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">He also described that DarkSky International is developing policy templates for state legislation and municipal ordinances, noting that language should be concise, accessible, consistent, and accurate.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Billy Tubb from the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) described some of the history and efforts of the IES. The IES believes that education on lighting is critical. Billy noted that the technological landscape for lighting has changed dramatically, with LEDs virtually replacing other types of lighting within the last 10 years; LEDs offer opportunities as more controllable and can be designed to be good for dark skies. Billy described some of the IES standards and notes that the IES intends to update their standards every two years. All of these are available (at a cost) through the IES lighting library.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Challenges and Opportunities</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">During a short morning breakout session, groups were asked to discuss large scale goals and challenges. Feedback included:</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">Key way to promote dark skies is through promoting the economic benefits.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Education is key: why does darkness matter and why is it important? Need to educate people and have them contact legislators, show up at city council meetings, etc. It takes individual actions to promote quality lighting. Shift perception from ‘dark is a four-letter word’. Promote connection with biodiversity protection.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">How to show people that brighter is not better? Create a different message about lighting quality not relying on brightness. Ecotourism, eco-biodiversity, eco-star (saving the ecology around all the different things being affected by light pollution).</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Enforcement is a challenge, but important: educate code enforcement, educate Albuquerque, Santa Fe, etc.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">Need to promote shielded lighting.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">Needs to be a more direct approach to address light trespass</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Use imagery to show the impact of lighting issues: fireflies, insects attracted to lighting, etc.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Broaden support : involve tribal organizations, involve angler (which rely on insects), other.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Think of other things to advertise like bat populations.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Have a ready-resource center available for people so everyone (citizens and city councils) can refer to the same information.</p></li><li data-list-text="●"><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">How do you approach the “enemy”?
