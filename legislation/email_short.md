Dear Senator XX,

I'm contacting you to express my strong support for SB34, a bill to update the Night Sky Protection Act, that will be heard in the Senate
Conservation Committee this week. Presering our ancestral skies is important to me (because ....) and I urge you to support the bill. Thank you!

Dear Senator (or Representative)  XX,

I'm contacting you as a constituent to express my strong support for SB 34 in the the 2025 legislative session that will update the existing Night Sky Protection Act and to ask you to support it.

New Mexico has a valuable resource in its dark skies: they attract visitors and new residents, are part of our cultural heritage, and are important for human health and wildlife. The state recognized this in 1999 and passed the Night Sky Protection Act. However, much has changed in the last 25 years, and light pollution has continued to increase.  Fortunately, new technology and increased awareness has led us to recognize that we can implement responsible lighting that meets or exceeds needs including safety and security while at the same time protecting our skies and the values that they offer.

The New Mexico Chapter of DarkSky International is proposing some small, but impactful, modifications to the Night Sky Protection Act, requiring new lighting to be shielded to a modern standard and to remove some of the exemptions in the original act that are no longer necessary.  These are common-sense changes that will help to keep light pollution from continuing to increase.

Dear Senator (or Representative)  XX,

Since the 1999 Dark Sky Protection Act (NSPA) was passed, modern LED lighting technology combined with poor application practices has resulted in the rapid growth of light pollution and loss of our naturally dark skies. The NSPA has proven to be inadequate to protect our night skies so SB34 has was drafted to more effectively protect our naturally dark skies. 

Modern lighting fixtures and installation practices are now available that meet the highest safely standards while also protecting our night skies which retires any need for industry wide exemptions. The bill includes many common sense exemptions like sports centers and movie film sets. 

These new lighting standards cost no more to install than old lighting practices and save on maintenance and energy costs too. 

SB34 establishes modern lighting standards to meet safety and lighting needs equally well for all public and industry lighting applications. The new standards do not cause any disadvantage or higher costs for private or public uses. Actually,  new lighting projects designed to new standards can cost less than existing standards and cost far less to maintain and operate.

This Bill protects New Mexico’s dark natural resources. As a voter and taxpayer of New Mexico, I need you to support SB34.

Senate Bill 34 would have a positive impact not only on the economy of New Mexico, but the health of its citizens, the migratory birds and pollinators and biodiversity of our state, and the welfare and benefit of the observatories vital to our national defense.

The night sky does not belong to any individual or individual entity. It exists for everyone who lives in New Mexico and those who come to visit our state to observe it. It is a resource for all of us, owned by none of us. Just as rivers and streams should not be polluted, just as the land and air should not be polluted, the night sky should not be polluted with light.

 While some will tout economic statistics based on supposition as opposed to verifiable facts, a fact is you cannot put a price on being able to see the stars at night. You cannot put a price on migratory birds being able to navigate at night by the starts and not be confused by “stars” shining from the ground.  You cannot put a price on the disappearance of bees and other pollinating creatures. You cannot put a price on the barrenness of vegetation that would be created if pollinators are destroyed by artificial light at night.

 What price can we put on our national defense if an observatory that tracks missile launches, satellites launched by adversarial nations such as North Korea, or measures meteors and asteroids that may enter our atmosphere cannot turn its telescope north over Albuquerque because the light pollution essentially blinds it?

 The financial cost of this bill is no more impactful on anyone or any industry than when we changed from leaded to unleaded gasoline fully in 1996. To say the Night Sky Protection Act from that time is sufficient is tantamount to complaining we shouldn’t have to drive unleaded gasoline or catalytic converter equipped vehicles. 

 The light that causes light pollution is essentially wasted light. By controlling light as this bill puts forth, less light and electricity is wasted.

As a voter and taxpayer of New Mexico, I and New Mexico need you to support SB34.
