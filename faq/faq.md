**My neighbor has bright lights that bother me, what can I do?**

This is a common question that doesn't always have a simple answer!
DarkSky International, and the New Mexico chapter, generally don't
get directly involved in specific individual lighting issues. DarkSky
International does have a [web page](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/light-pollution-solutions/lighting/my-neighbors-lighting/)
about the issue with some ideas.
Note there is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EwvZvuvBNY&feature=youtu.be) there
that discusses how one person approached the issue. [GNAR](https://extension.usu.edu/gnar/) also has a
["Good neighbor" toolkit](https://extension.usu.edu/gnar/tools/ds-tools/good_neighbor) that may be useful.

Generally, being confrontational doesn't help to solve the situation,
and sometimes it takes time to get the situation resolved. A good start
is to become well informed on the issue, and then move on to talking
with your neighbors. Some things to consider:
  - Make sure **your** property uses responsible lighting: [good lighting starts
at home](https://darksky.org/what-we-do/advancing-responsible-outdoor-lighting/home/)!
  - Learn about the concept of light trespass, which might be persuasive
to some people: you can acknowledge their right to light their property as
they see fit, but ask them to recognize that neighbors also have the right to have
their property protected.
  - Learn about the benefits of responsible lighting so that you can 
communicate them: responsible lighting not only makes for a good neighbor,
but it also is safer, provides better security, saves energy and money,
helps wildlife, and makes your community more attractive
  - Give people credit where they have good lighting: maybe you want
to talk with neighbors who have good lighting as much as with those
that have less good lighting, so you can work towards a solution of which
the whole neighborhood can be proud
  - Learn about local ordinances: while it might not be productive to
try to "throw the book" at neighbors, being able to calmly talk with
them about existing regulations might be helpful
  - Be constructive: learn about [DarkSky certified lighting fixtures that satisfy responsible
lighting principles](https://darksky.org/what-we-do/darksky-approved/#!/Residential/c/12499367/offset=0&sort=nameAsc) 
and can help to keep light only where it is needed/desired, so you can
suggest some solutions that keep light where the neighbors want it, but
not where you don't!

While the chapter does not have the capacity to get involved in
negotiating individual situations, some of our individual council members have
been willing to try to look at some individual situations, at
least from the perspective of trying to provide input about
whether the lighting is compliant with existing ordinances or
not. If you email some photos of the situation to newmexico@darksky.org, we
can see if anyone has any input and/or useful suggestions
or information.

**There is a bright streetlight near my home that shines into my house/yard and
bothers me, what can I do?**

  - Find out what jurisdiction is responsible for the offending light(s): is it the
city, county, etc?  
  - Determine who is responsible for setting policy for that jurisdiction and, especially,
who your local representative is. 
  - Learn about whether there are any ordinances in place for your jurisdiction. If
ordinances exist, learn about what agency is responsible for enforcing them.
  - Learn about the benefits of responsible lighting so that you can 
communicate them: responsible lighting not only makes for a good neighbor,
but it also is safer, provides better security, saves energy and money,
helps wildlife, and makes your community more attractive
  - Communicate politely with your policy makers and enforcement agency (if appropriate)
and let them know of your issue, why you think it is important,
and ask them if there is anything they can do to help, either at the enforcement
level or the policy level
  - Talk to your neighbors and have them make the same communication(s) if they 
share your concern.

Be aware that it may take time for culture to change and for
responsible lighting to be installed. Many policy makers and agencies
just assume that residents want more lighting, and only by having
multiple residents tell them that this is not the case will the
situation change!  You might be surprised that it doesn't take that
many people who politely register their concerns to make a difference!

<A NAME=literature></A>
**How can I get more information about research on responsible lighting and dark skies?**

DarkSky International releases an annual report on 
[Artificial light at night: State of the Science](https://darksky.org/what-we-do/advancing-responsible-outdoor-lighting/research/)
and, along with the Loss of the Night Network, DarkSky maintains a comprehensive, searchable 
[database of scientific publications on artificial light at night (ALAN)](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2913367/alan_db/library).
These are great resources for getting data on various related issues!
