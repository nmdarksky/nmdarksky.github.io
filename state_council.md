**Nick Knorr**

![image](bios/knorr.png){: style="float: left ; width: 20% ; padding: 15px"}
Nick Knorr is a happily retired banker, living in Santa Fe.  He is
an avid hiker and backpacker.  He believes that connection with the
natural order, which is ever diminishing, is an essential touchstone
of human existence.  That order is nowhere more apparent than in
the night sky to those who are not blinded by light.  He cannot
forget visiting the Hayden Planetarium as a boy and discovering the
vastness of the universe.  Although he abandoned astronomy for other
pursuits, he remains fascinated by the scientific exploration of
the universe through space and time.

**Peter Lipscomb**

![image](bios/lipscomb.jpg){: style="float: left ; width: 20% ; padding: 15px"}
Peter has been involved in dark sky preservation and education
efforts for two decades. First in 2004, as a volunteer supporting
Chaco Culture National Historical Park and its astronomy program
during a memorable Mars opposition summer. Next as Director of the
New Mexico Heritage Preservation Alliance Night Sky Program (NMHPA)
where he produced the Alliance’s Night Sky Conference at Taos, NM in 2007. 
He actively backed efforts to strengthen enforcement language
in the New Mexico Night Sky Protection Act in 2007 and 2009. He attended
legislative committee meetings, directly engaged with key legislators,
created lobby fliers and information sheets, rallied statewide
contacts for support emails and phone calls to committee members
for upcoming sessions.

He completed five contract cycles with New Mexico State Parks (NMSPD)
as “Reach for the Stars” program contractor, providing public
programs at parks statewide, curriculum development, maintenance
of astronomy equipment and facilities, and training for volunteers
and staff. He authored the nomination packet for designation of
Clayton Lake State Park as New Mexico’s first International Dark-Sky
Park and supported ordinance efforts in Clayton and Union County,
Rio Arriba County, Taos, and Taos County.

In 2002, he founded Astronomy Adventures, a guided night sky tour
business. Over the years, he has shared views of the wonderful and
increasingly rare quality of New Mexico’s dark sky with thousands
of people from across the country and around the world.  He wrote
the weekly Night Skies column for the Santa Fe New Mexican 2007-2010.
In 2016, Peter was honored by the Santa Fe Conservation Trust with
the Stewart Udall award for his night sky activism.  His public
engagement work with the NMHPA, NMSPD, New Mexico Legislature, local
ordinance action, and interpretive education efforts has emphasized
the broad-based importance of the nighttime environment. Its role
as a natural and cultural resource and how it supports biodiversity,
protects cultural heritage, conserves energy production, enhances
our health and safety, bolsters economic benefits of scientific
research and astro-tourism while fulfilling our need for wonder,
awe, serenity, and a universal connectedness to inspire our creativity
and imagination.

In addition to his full-time work with New Mexico State Parks, Peter
is a New Mexico regional team leader for the NASA Earth to Sky
Program, serves as lead tech for Deep Sky West remote observatory
in Rowe, NM, and hosts Sky Railway’s Stargazer train. He is delighted
to have been a part of forming the New Mexico DarkSky chapter.

**Sarah McIntyre**

I'm a scientist and photographer/astrophotographer in Albuquerque.
I am a lifelong New Mexican, and have spent my entire life appreciating
New Mexico's dark skies. As my longstanding interest in astronomy
has expanded into astrophotography (and that has expanded from
nightscapes to deep space imagery) in recent years, the importance
of taking action to protect our dark skies has become increasingly
important to me. I'm excited to be a member of NM DarkSky and look
forward to being involved with efforts to educate the public and
raise awareness of dark skies as a vital natural resource.

**Colin Nichols**

Colin Nicholls is a PhD Physicist who spent the first 20 years of
his career developing advanced instrumentation for industrial process
control in Hi Tech research institutions in the US and the UK.  For
the last 23 years he has worked in education in Taos county, first
at Taos High School and now at UNM Taos, where he is currently
Science Department Chair.  A long time visual astronomer, Nicholls
is on the board of the El Valle Astronomers and is working with
that club,  UNM Taos and the Taos County planners to update the
county’s Dark Sky ordinances.


**Jim Price**

Jim Price is practically a native New Mexican. He has lived in
Albuquerque since most of what is now developed was dirt. Jim worked
for a lighting company and then started his own. He has sold lighting
ranging from miniature lighting for microscopes to parking lot
lighting for every type of business. Jim realized the need for
shielded lighting when shopping malls and other businesses around
Albuquerque with parking lots enlisted him to help them be better
neighbors. He realized then that lighting can be made more comfortable
and effective through proper aiming and shielding. He has adopted
a less is more philosophy with lighting. For example, less glare
means more visual acuity. Less stark contrast means more awareness
of surroundings. He truly believes that taking the “less” approach
leads to “more” satisfying results.

**Didier Saumon**

![image](bios/Saumon.jpg){: style="float: left ; width: 20% ; padding: 15px"}
Didier Saumon has been an amateur astronomer for nearly 50 years
and has a fondness for visual observations of the deep sky and
exotic objects. He enjoys sharing his passion for the night sky
with the public at star parties in the surrounding area. Until his
recent retirement, he was an astrophysicist  studying white dwarfs,
brown dwarfs, exoplanets, and the properties of matter under the
extreme conditions found in these objects. He's had an interest in
outdoor lighting and light pollution for three decades and contributed
to the development and adoption of a modern lighting ordinance in
the county of Los Alamos. He's witnessed the steady erosion of the
night sky over the past 20 years and wants to see it stopped. On
good days, he dreams of seeing it reversed to a reasonable level
for the benefit of all. May the stars be with you.

**Gary Starkweather**

![image](bios/starkweather.jpg){: style="float: left ; width: 20% ; padding: 15px"}
My name is Gary Starkweather and I’m a Dark Sky International (DSI) member and a
council member of New Mexico DarkSky (NMDS). Let me briefly explain why DSI and
NMDS membership is of particular interest to me. After retiring in 2007, I chose to
continue my interest in astronomy and amateur astrophotography as a hobby.  In 2012,
after looking for a place with dark skies, I moved to an astronomy community in Luna
County, New Mexico at New Mexico Astronomy Village (NMAV) near Deming, NM.
NMAV had very dark skies and the State of New Mexico had a Dark Sky Protection Act
which I reasonably believed would protect the naturally dark skies of New Mexico.

In 2015, I moved into a new house at NMAV and by 2023, I completed construction of
three observatories. During the years of construction I realized that I was wrong about
the state’s Dark Sky Protection Act actually protecting the naturally dark skies. The Act
turned out to do virtually nothing to protect the sky. Local counties and towns wouldn’t
enforce the state’s outdoor lighting regulations; they simply ignored the Dark Sky
Protection Act as if it didn’t exist. 

My wife and I invested our life savings moving to New Mexico where we could enjoy
dark skies. We were disappointed because locals were content with ruining the night
skies, and the rate of loss was accelerating. Our story is not unique. There is a large
community of professional and amateur astronomers in New Mexico that are also
watching the rapid destruction of our naturally dark skies. We are looking for ways to
stop the loss of our dark skies and reverse some of the damage that has already
happened. 

Retirement shouldn’t be about spending time protecting retirement investments from
destruction by others, yet, here we are. That is why I have joined the New Mexico
DarkSky team, in hopes that this alliance, along with other like minded, people will be
able to make a difference in protecting naturally dark skies.

**Derek Wallentinsen**  

![image](bios/wallentinsen.jpg){: style="float: left ; width: 20% ; padding: 15px"}
Derek Wallentinsen is an independent educator who has been deeply involved in
astronomy outreach and dark skies preservation throughout his life. He is a NASA
JPL Solar System Ambassador, NASA ASP Eclipse Ambassador and AUI Astronomy
in Chile Educator Ambassador, sharing astronomy knowledge with broadly diverse
groups of the public. He has lived in NM since 1958 and has been active in private
and public dark-sky vocations. An early activist for dark skies, Derek drafted a
night-sky friendly municipal lighting ordinance in the 1970s. During his time as a
National Park Service ranger, Derek was instrumental in the certification of
several national parks as International Dark Sky Parks (including Dinosaur
National Monument and El Morro National Monument) and was the recipient of
three STAR awards. He currently is an AstroVIP at several national parks,
monitoring their dark skies and creating various outreach programs and videos.
He formerly worked at the telescope company Celestron and originated the
company’s online knowledgebase.  
Wallentinsen has a Master of Science degree in Astrophysics. In addition to
telescopes, night and day skies, he enjoys desert hiking, geology and birds from
his home base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  
“I want to see New Mexico’s Dark Sky International chapter broaden out to reach
beyond astronomy to biology, human health and cultural impacts.”
